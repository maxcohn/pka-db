# Contributing Guidelines

Before doing anything, check if there is already an issue, either past or present.

## Found a bug?

Create an issue detailing what steps led up the the bug occuring and mark it as
a bug.

## Suggest a feature?

Create an issue detailing the suggested feature detailing the idea and any possible
ideas for implementation.

I have a vision for this website in my head that involved keeping it relatively
minimal and accountless, meaning there will never be registered users. My goal
for this is to keep it as an open resource without any barriers to entry for use.

## Working on an issue?

Write a comment on the issue you want to work saying you're going to try it. Please
don't work on issues that people are already working on, it'll make things messy
otherwise. If an issue is claimed and there is no progress after a couple days,
comment and make a claim.
